A working implementation of Conway's game of life in python using PyGame.

To get this working, install pygame using pip install pygame/ pip3 install pygame. Run the game using python main.py.

The controls for the game are:

1). Click to fill a cell, click again to empty it.
2). 'g' to generate a randomly filled grid of cells.
3). 'r' to clear the grid.
4). Spacebar to start or stop the simulation. It is paused by default.
5). Escape to quit the game.
